plan to redo all the analysis with only informative SNPs for each sample.
This folder contains:
1. script for getting informative SNP lists (.txt) for microhaplotype analysis. This script also outputs parental microhaplotypes with only informative SNPS.
2. script for adding vcf header to each SNP list and converting the .txtx file to .vcf file
