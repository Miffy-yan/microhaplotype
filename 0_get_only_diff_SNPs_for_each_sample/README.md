plan to redo all the analysis with only informative SNPs for each sample.
This folder contains:
1. script for getting informative SNP lists (.txt) for microhaplotype analysis. This script also outputs parental microhaplotypes with only informative SNPS. This script also outpus unique paternal ones, both long version and short version.
2. script for adding vcf header to each SNP list and converting the .txtx file to .vcf file
3. script for getting clean lists
